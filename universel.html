              <li>The universal selector provided by CSS helps in choosing any elements within the HTML page</li>
              <li>It goes with a single element and uses the asterisk (i.e., "*") symbol used for denoting the selector as a universal selector</li>
              <li>It is usually written as an asterisk followed by a selector. The * is used for selecting all elements</li>
              <li>This asterisk also has the capability to select all elements that are inside another element</li>
              <li>The universal selector becomes helpful when you wish to put a specific style in all the HTML elements within your web page</li>
             <li>It can also be used for every single element that is within the element of your HTML page</li>
